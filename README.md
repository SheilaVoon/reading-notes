## Growth Mindset :brain:

Is instead of having a fixed mindset, it is having a mindset that is willing to learn new things.

### Reminders of how to keep a growth mindset
- When faced with obstacles there are so many distractions that can cause us to lose focus, and we need to remember to ***persist***.
- When it becomes challenginging, we need to ***embrace*** that challenge to overcome it
- We need to remember that ***no pain ,means no gain***. We need to continue our efforts even if it may seem fruitless.
