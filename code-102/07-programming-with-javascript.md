# Programming with JavaScript

## 1. What is ```control flow```?

* It refers to the order in which statements are executed in your code.
* JavaScript typically follows a top-down, sequential execution.
* However, control flow statements can alter this order, allowing for conditional execution and looping.
* Examples of control flow statements include:
  * Conditional statements: ```if```, ```else if```, ```else```
  * Loops: ```for```, ```while```, ```do-while```
  * Break and continue: ```break``` exits a loop early, ```continue``` skips to the next iteration.

## 2. What is a JavaScript ```function```?

* Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
* They help organize code, make it more readable, and avoid repetition.
* To define a function, use the ```function``` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses ```()```, and curly braces ```{}``` enclosing the code.

## 3. What does it mean to ```invoke``` - or ```call``` - a function?

* To execute a function's code, you "invoke" or "call" it.

## 4. What are the parenthesis ```()``` for when you define a function?

* They serve two purposes:
  1. Holding parameters
  2. Distinguishing function calls from other expressions
