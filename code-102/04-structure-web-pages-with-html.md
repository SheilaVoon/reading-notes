# Structure web pages with HTML

## 1. What is HTML and why do we use it?

* HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the fundamental building block of web pages. It's a standardized language used to create the structure and content of web documents.

* We use HTML for:
  * Defining the basic structure of a web page (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
  * Adding text, images, videos, and other content to the page
  * Creating links to other pages and resources
  * Organizing content into sections and headings
  * Emphasizing certain parts of text
  * Marking up quotes and citations
  * Establishing a foundation for styling and interactivity with CSS and JavaScript

## 2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

* Opening tag: Marks the beginning of an element, enclosed in angle brackets ```(< >)```. Example: ```<p>``` for a paragraph.
* Content: The text or other content that goes within the element. Example: The actual text within the paragraph.
* Closing tag: Marks the end of an element, using a forward slash before the element name. Example: ```</p>``` to close the paragraph.

## 3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

* Attributes: These are name-value pairs added within the opening tag of an element to provide additional information or instructions. Example: ```<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">```

## 4. What is a semantic element?

* Semantic elements are HTML elements that clearly convey their meaning to both humans and machines. They describe the content's purpose rather than just its appearance.

* Examples:
  * ```<header>``` for the header section of a page
  * ```<nav>``` for navigation links
  * ```<article>``` for main content
  * ```<section>``` for grouping related content
  * ```<footer>``` for the footer section of a page
  * ```<aside>``` for content that is tangentially related to the main content
