# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## 1. What are variables in JavaScript?

* Variables are named containers that store data values in JavaScript. They act as placeholders for information that can be used throughout your code.

* They allow you to manage and manipulate data dynamically during program execution.

* Variables can hold different types of data, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more.

## 2. What does it mean to declare a variable?

* Declaring a variable means introducing it to the JavaScript interpreter, giving it a name, and optionally assigning an initial value.

* It's a way of telling JavaScript that you're going to use a certain variable name to refer to a specific piece of data.

* You use the ```let```, or ```const``` keywords to declare variables in JavaScript.

## 3.What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

* The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.

* It places the value on the right side of the operator into the variable on the left side.

* Example: ```let age = 30```; assigns the value 30 to the variable ```age```.

## 4. What is information received from the user called?

* Information received from the user is called user input.

* It's typically obtained through elements like text boxes, buttons, or other interactive components in a web page or application.

* In JavaScript, you can use methods like ```prompt()``` to retrieve user input.
